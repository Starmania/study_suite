 * serving last year's planning, so it is resolved per run instead.
 *
 * Picking the *first* project with any events — which is what the reference
 * implementation does — only works while the requested range excludes past

 * and sticks to it. Taking the busiest project in the window, highest id
 * winning ties, rolls over on its own and tolerates next year's skeleton
